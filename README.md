# Russia–Ukraine War — analysis scripts and outputs

This repository contains scripts and data used for analyzing aspects of the Russia–Ukraine war.

Note: the classification scripts are in `lib/` and their output files are stored under `lib/Outputs/` (for example `lib/Outputs/Russia` and `lib/Outputs/Ukraine`).

Repository structure (partial):

- `lib/` — analysis scripts (e.g. `classify_location.py`, `generate_features.py`, `translate.py`)
- `lib/Outputs/` — classification outputs and other generated files
- `Russia/`, `Ukraine/` — country-specific data
